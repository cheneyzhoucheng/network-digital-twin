# Introduction

The fast growth of network scale and the increased demand on these
networks require them to accommodate and adapt dynamically to customer
needs, implying a significant challenge to network operators. Indeed,
network operation and maintenance are becoming more complex due to the
higher complexity of the managed networks and the sophisticated services
they deliver. As such, providing innovations on network technologies,
management, and operation will be more and more challenging due to the
high risk of interfering with existing services and the higher trial
costs if no reliable emulation platforms are available.

A Digital Twin is the real-time representation of a physical entity in
the digital world. It has the characteristics of virtual-reality
interrelation and real-time interaction, iterative operation and process
optimization, full life-cycle and comprehensive data-driven network
infrastructure. Digital twin has been widely acknowledged in academic
publications and adopted in Industry 4.0. See more in {{concept}}.

A digital twin for networks can be built by applying Digital Twin
technologies to networks and creating a virtual image of real network
facilities (called herein, emulation). Basically, the digital twin for
networks is an expansion platform of network emulation and can be seen
as a tool for scenario planning, impact analysis, and change management.
Compared to conventional network simulation, the main difference is the
interactive virtual-real mapping and data-driven approach to build
closed-loop network automation. Integrating network digital twin into
the network management allows network maintenance engineers to assess,
model, and tweak optimization strategies in a risk-free environment,
ensuring that only the most effective changes might be implemented in
the real network (i.e., subject to adequate validation and control checks).
Digital twin for networks provide crucial data for network failure root
cause analysis, and a sandbox for assessing hypotheses and validating the
outcomes of data-driven insights without impacting end-users.

Through the real-time data interaction between the real network and its
twin network(s), the Network Digital Twin (NDT) platform will provide
the data for NDT-based applications and network designers to achieve
greater simplification, automation, resilience testing (“what if scenarios”),
and full life-cycle operation and infrastructure maintenance.

# Introduction of Concepts  {#concept}

## Background of Digital Twin

The concept of the "twin" dates to the National Aeronautics and Space
Administration (NASA) Apollo program in the 1970s, where a replica of
space vehicles on Earth was built to mirror the condition of the
equipment during the mission {{Rosen2015}}.

In 2003, Digital Twin was attributed to John Vickers by Michael
Grieves in his Product Lifecycle Management (PLM) course as "virtual
digital representation equivalent to physical products"
{{Grieves2014}}.  Digital twin can be defined as a virtual instance of
a physical system (twin) that is continually updated with the
latter's performance, maintenance, and health status data throughout
the physical system's life cycle {{Madni2019}}.  By providing a living
copy of physical system, digital twins bring numerous advantages,
such as accelerated business processes, enhanced productivity, and
faster innovation with reduced costs.  So far, digital twin has been
successfully applied in the fields of intelligent manufacturing,
smart city, or complex system operation and maintenance to help with
not only object design and testing, but also management aspects
{{Tao2019}}.

Compared with 'digital model' and 'digital shadow', the key
difference of 'digital twin' is the direction of data between the
physical and virtual systems {{Fuller2020}}.  Typically, when using a
digital twin, the (twin) system is generated and then synchronized
using data flows in both directions between physical and digital
components, so that control data can be sent, and changes between the
physical and digital objectives of systems are automatically
represented.  This behavior is unlike a 'digital model' or 'digital
shadow', which are usually synchronized manually, lacking of control
data, and might not have a full cycle of data integrated.

At present (2024), there is no unified definition of digital twin
framework.  The industry, scientific research institutions, and
standards developing organizations are trying to define a general or
domain-specific framework of digital twin.  {{Natis-Gartner2017}}
proposed that building a digital twin of a physical entity requires
four key elements: model, data, monitoring, and uniqueness.
{{Tao2019}} proposed a five-dimensional framework of digital twin {PE,
VE, SS, DD, CN}, in which PE represents physical entity, VE
represents virtual entity, SS represents service, DD represents twin
data, and CN represents the connection between various components.
{{ISO-2021}} issued a draft standard for digital twin manufacturing
system, and proposed a reference framework including data collection
domain, device control domain, digital twin domain, and user domain.

## Digital Twin for Networks

Communication networks provide a solid foundation for implementing
various 'digital twin' applications.  At the same time, in the face
of increasing business types, scale and complexity, a network itself
also needs to use digital twin technology to seek enhanced and
optimized solutions compared to relying solely on the real network.
The motivation for network digital twin can somehow be traced back to
some earlier concepts, such as "shadow MIB", inductive modeling
techniques, parallel systems, etc.  Since 2017, the application of
digital twin technology in the field of communication networks has
gradually been researched as illustrated by the (non-exhaustive) list
of examples that are listed hereafter.

Within academia, {{Dong2019}} established the digital twin of 5G mobile
edge computing (MEC) network, used the twin offline to train the
resource allocation optimization and normalized energy-saving
algorithm based on reinforcement learning, and then updated the
scheme to MEC network.  {{Dai2020}} established a digital twin edge
network for mobile edge computing system, in which a twin edge server
is used to evaluate the state of entity server, and the twin mobile
edge computing system provides data for training offloading strategy.
{{Nguyen2021}} discusses how to deploy a digital twin for complex 5G
networks.  {{Hong2021}} presents a digital twin platform towards
automatic and intelligent management for data center networks, and
then proposes a simplified the workflows of network service
management.  {{Dai2022}} gives the concept of digital twin and proposes
an digital twin-enabled vehicular edge computing (VEC) network, where
digital twin can enable adaptive network management via the two-
closed loops between physical VEC networks and digital twins.  In
addition, international workshops dedicated to digital twin in
networking field have already appeared, such as IEEE DTPI 2021&2022-
Digital Twin Network Online Session {{DTPI2021}}, {{DTPI2022}}, and IEEE
NOMS 2022 - TNT workshop {{TNT2022}}.

Although the application of digital twin technology in networking has
started, the research of digital twin for networks technology is
still in its infancy.  Current applications focus on specific
scenarios (such as network optimization), where network digital twin
is just used as a network simulation tool to solve the problem of
network operation and maintenance.  Combined with the characteristics
of digital twin technology and its application in other industries,
this document believes that network digital twin can be regarded as
an indispensable part of the overall network system and provides a
general architecture involving the whole life cycle of real network
in the future, serving the application of network innovative
technologies such as network planning, construction, maintenance and
optimization, improving the automation and intelligence level of the
network.

# Characteristics of Network Digital Twin  {#def}

So far, there is no standard definition for characteristic of "network
digital twin" within the networking industry.  This document introduces
four key elements (i.e., data, models, mapping, and interfaces) to
characterize the network digital twin. These four elements can be
integrated into a network management system to analyze, diagnose, emulate,
and control the real network. To that aim, a real-time and interactive
mapping is required between the real network and its virtual twin network.
Whether a Digital Twin supports all or a subset of the functions above
(i.e., analyze, diagnose, emulate, and control) is deployment specific.

Referring to the characteristics of digital twin in other industries and
the characteristics of the networking itself, the digital twin
network should involve at least four key elements: data, mapping, models and
interfaces as shown in {{kelem}}.

  Data:
  :  A network digital twin should maintain historical data and/or
  real time data (configuration data, operational state data,
  topology data, trace data, metric data, process data, etc.) about
  its real-world twin (i.e. real network) that are required by the
  models to represent and understand the states and behaviors of the
  real-world twin.
  : The data is characterized as the single source of "truth" and
  populated in the data repository, which provides timely and
  accurate data service support for building various models.

  Models:
  :  Techniques that involve collecting data from one or more
  sources in the real-world twin and developing a comprehensive
  representation of the data (e.g., system, entity, or process) using
  specific models.  These models are used as emulation and diagnosis
  basis to provide dynamics and elements on how the live real
  network operates and generates reasoning data utilized for
  decision-making.
  : Various models such as service models, data models, dataset
  models, or knowledge graph can be used to represent the real
  network assets and, then, instantiated to serve various network
  applications.

  Interfaces:
  :  Standardized interfaces ensure the interoperability
  of network digital twin.  There are two major types of interfaces:

    *  The interface between the network digital twin platform and the
     real network infrastructure.

    *  The interface between network digital twin platform and
     applications.

  : The former provides real-time data collection and control on the
  real network.  The latter helps in delivering application requests
  to the network digital twin platform and exposing the various
  platform capabilities to applications.

  Mapping:
  : Used to identify the digital twin and the underlying
  entities and establish a real-time interactive relation between
  the real network and the twin network or between two twin
  networks.  The mapping can be:

    *  One to one (pairing, vertical): Synchronize between a real
     network and its virtual twin network with continuous flows.

    *  One to many (coupling, horizontal): Synchronize among virtual
     twin networks with occasional data exchange.

  : Such mappings provide a good visibility of actual status, making
  the digital twin suitable to analyze and understand what is going
  on in the real network.  It also allows using the digital twin to
  optimize the performance and maintenance of the real network.

The network digital twin constructed based on the four core
technology elements can analyze, diagnose, emulate, and control the
real network in its whole life cycle with the help of optimization
algorithms, management methods, and expert knowledge.  One of the
objectives of such control is to master the network digital twin
environment and its elements to derive the required system behavior,
e.g., provide:

*  repeatability: that is the capacity to replicate network
  conditions on-demand.

*  reproducibility: i.e., the ability to replay successions of
  events, possibly under controlled variations.

and "the mirroring pace and scope" should be controlled for a given
twin instance.

> Note: Realtime interaction is not always mandatory for all twins.
For example, when assessing some configuration changes or emulating some innovative
techniques, the digital twins can behave as an isolated simulation platform
without the need of realtime telemetry data. It might be useful to have interactive
mapping capability so that the validated changes can be evaluated under real network
conditions whenever required by the testers.  Whether realtime interaction between
virtual and real network is mandatory is a configurable parameter. Adequate validation
guards have to be enforced at both twin and physical network. Enabling realtime
interaction in network digital twin is a catalyst to achieve autonomous networks or
self-driven network.

# Benefits of Network Digital Twin

Network digital twin can help enabling closed-loop network management
across the entire lifecycle, from deployment and emulation, to
visualized assessment, physical deployment, and continuous
verification.  By doing so, network operators and end-users to some
extent, as allowed by specific application interfaces, can maintain a
global, systemic, and consistent view of the network.  Also, network
operators and/or enterprise user can safely exercise the enforcement
of network planning policies, deployment procedures, etc., without
jeopardizing the daily operation of the real network.

The main difference between network digital twin and simulation
platform is the use of interactive virtual-real mapping to build
closed-loop network automation.  Simulation platforms are the
predecessor of the network digital twin, one example of such a
simulation platform is network simulator {{NS-3}}, which can be seen as
a variant of network digital twin but with low fidelity and lacking
for interactive interfaces to the real network.  Compared with those
classical approaches, key benefits of network digital twin can be
summarized as follows:

{: counter="bar" style="format (%c)"}
* Using real-time data to establish high fidelity twins, the
   effectiveness of network simulation is higher; then the
   simulation cost will be relatively low.

*  The impact and risk on running networks is low when automatically
   applying configuration/policy changes after the full analysis and
   required verifications (e.g., service impact analysis) within the
   twin network.

*  The faults of the real network can be automatically captured by
   analyzing real-time data, then the correction strategy can be
   distributed to the real network elements after conducting
   adequate analysis within the twins to complete the closed-loop
   automatic fault repair.

The following subsections further elaborate such benefits in details.

## Optimized Network Total Cost of Operation

Large scale networks are complex to operate.  Since there is no
effective platform for simulation, network optimization designs have
to be tested on the real network at the cost of jeopardizing its
daily operation and possibly degrading the quality of the services
supported by the network.  Such assessment greatly increases network
operator's Operational Expenditure (OPEX) budgets too.

With a network digital twin platform, network operators can safely
emulate candidate optimization solutions before deploying them on the
real network.  In addition, operator's OPEX on the real network
deployment will be greatly decreased accordingly at the cost of the
complexity of the assessment and the resources involved.

## Optimized Decision Making

Traditional network operation and management mainly focus on
deploying and managing running services, but hardly support
predictive maintenance techniques.

Network digital twin can combine data acquisition, big data
processing, and AI modeling to assess the status of the network, but
also to predict future trends, and better organize predictive
maintenance.  The ability to reproduce network behaviors under
various conditions facilitates the corresponding assessment of the
various evolution options as often as required.

## Safer Assessment of Innovative Network Capabilities

Testing a new feature in an operational network is not only complex,
but also extremely risky.  Service impact analysis is required to be
adequately achieved prior to effective activation of a new feature.

Network digital twin can greatly help assessing innovative network
capabilities without jeopardizing the daily operation of the real
network.  In addition, it helps researchers to explore network
innovation (e.g., new network protocols, network AI/ML applications)
efficiently, and network operators to deploy new technologies quickly
with lower risks.  Take AI/ ML application as example, it is a
conflict between the continuous high reliability requirement (i.e.,
99.999%) and the slow learning speed or phase-in learning steps of
AI/ML algorithms.  With network digital twin, AI/ML can complete the
learning and training with the sufficient data before deploying the
model in the real network.  This would encourage more network AI
innovations in future networks.

## Privacy and Regulatory Compliance

The requirements on data confidentiality and privacy on network
providers increase the complexity of network management, as decisions
made by computation logics such as an SDN controller may rely upon
the packet payloads.  As a result, the improvement of data-driven
management requires complementary techniques that can provide a
strict control based upon security mechanisms to guarantee data
privacy protection and regulatory compliance.  This may range from
flow identification (using the archetypal five-tuple of addresses,
ports and protocol) to techniques requiring some degree of payload
inspection, all of them considered suitable to be associated to an
individual person, and hence requiring strong protection and/or data
anonymization mechanisms.

With strong modeling capability provided by the network digital twin,
very limited real data (if at all) will be needed to achieve similar
or even higher level of data-driven intelligent analysis.  This way,
a lower demand of sensitive data will permit to satisfy privacy
requirements and simplify the use of privacy-preserving techniques
for data-driven operation.

## Customized Network Operation Training

Network architectures can be complex, and their operation requires
expert personnel.  Network digital twin offers an opportunity to
train staff for customized networks and specific user needs.  Two
salient examples are the application of new network architectures and
protocols or the use of "cyber-ranges" to train security experts in
threat detection and mitigation.

# Challenges to Build Network Digital Twin

According to {{Hu2021}}, the main challenges in building and
maintaining digital twins can be summarized as the following five
aspects:

*  Data acquisition and processing

*  High-fidelity modeling

*  Real-time, two-way communication between the virtual and the real
  twins

*  Unified development platform and tools

*  Environmental coupling technologies

Compared with other industrial fields, digital twin in networking
field has its unique characteristics.  On one hand, network elements
and system have higher level of digitalization, which implies that
data acquisition and virtual-real communication are relatively easy
to achieve.  On the other hand, there are various different type of
network elements and typologies in the network field; and the network
size is characterized by the numbers of nodes and links in it but the
network size growth pace can not meet the service needs, especially
in the deployment of end to end service which spans across multiple
administrative domains.  So, the construction of a digital twin
network system needs to consider the following major challenges:

  Large scale challenge:
  :  A digital twin of large-scale networks will
     significantly increase the complexity of data acquisition and
     storage, the design and implementation of relevant models.  The
     requirements of software and hardware of the network digital twin
     system will be even more constraining.  Therefore, efficient and
     low cost tools in various fields should be required.  Take data as
     an example, massive network data can help achieve more accurate
     models.  However, the cost of virtual-real communication and data
     storage becomes extremely expensive, especially in the multi-
     domain data-driven network management case, therefore efficient
     tools on data collection and data compression methods must be
     used.

  Interoperability:
  :  Due to the inconsistency of technical
     implementations and the heterogeneity of vendor adopted
     technologies, it is difficult to establish a unified digital twin
     network system with a common technology in a network domain.
     Therefore, it is needed firstly to propose a unified architecture
     of network digital twin, in which all components and
     functionalities are clear to all stakeholders; then define
     standardized and unified interfaces to connect all network twins
     via ensuring necessary compatibility.

  Data modeling difficulties:
  :  Based on large-scale network data, data
  modeling should not only focus on ensuring the accuracy of model
  functions, but also has to consider the flexibility and
  scalability to compose and extend as required to support large
  scale and multi-purpose applications.  Balancing these
  requirements further increases the complexity of building
  efficient and hierarchical functional data models.  As an optional
  solution, straightforwardly clone the real network using
  virtualized resources is feasible to build the twin network when
  the network scale is relatively small.  However, it will be of
  unaffordable resource cost for larger scales network.  In this
  case, network modeling using mathematical abstraction or
  leveraging the AI algorithms will be more suitable solutions.

  Real-time requirements:
  :  Network services normally have real-time
     requirements, the processing of model simulation and verification
     through a network digital twin will introduce the service latency.
     Meanwhile, the real-time requirements will further impose
     performance requirements on the system software and hardware.
     However, given the nature of distributed systems and propagation
     delays, it is challenge to keep network digital twins in sync or
     auto-sync between real network and network digital twin.
   : Changes to the digital object automatically drive changes in the real
     object can be even challenging.  To address these requirements,
     the function and process of the data model need to be based on
     automated processing mechanism under various network application
     scenarios.  On the one hand, it is needed to design a simplified
     process to reduce the time cost for tasks in network twin as much
     as possible; on the other hand, it is recommended to define the
     real-time requirements of different applications, and then match
     the corresponding computing resources and suitable solutions as
     needed to complete the task processing in the twin.

  Security risks:
  :  A network digital twin has to synchronize all or
     subset of the data related to involved real networks in real time,
     which inevitably augments the attack surface, with a higher risk
     of information leakage, in particular.  On one hand, it is
     mandatory to design more secure data mechanism leveraging legacy
     data protection methods, as well as innovative technologies such
     as block chain.  On the other hand, the system design can limit
     the data (especially raw data) requirement on building digital
     twin network, leveraging innovative modeling technologies such as
     federal learning.

To address the above listed challenges, it is important to
agree on a unified architecture of network digital twin, which
defines the main functional components and interfaces ({{arch}}).
Then, relying upon such an architecture, it is required to continue
researching on the key enabling technologies including data
acquisition, data storage, data modeling, interface standardization,
and security assurance.

# A Reference Architecture of Network Digital Twin  {#arch}

Based on the definition of the key network digital twin technology
elements introduced in {{def}}, a network digital twin
architecture is depicted in Figure 2.  This network digital twin
architecture is broken down into three layers: Application Layer,
Digital Twin Layer, and Real Network Layer.

  Real Network:
  :  All or subset of network elements in the real network
     exchange network data and control messages with a network digital
     twin instance, through twin-real control interfaces.  The real
     network can be a mobile access network, a transport network, a
     mobile core, a backbone, etc.  The real network can also be a data
     center network, a campus enterprise network, an industrial
     Internet of Things, etc.
   : The real network can span across a single network administrative
     domain or multiple network administrative domains.  And, the real
     network can include both physical entities and some virtual
     entities (e.g. vSwitches, NFVs, etc.), which together carry
     traffic and provide actual network services.
   : This document focuses on the IETF related real network such as IP
     bearer network and data center network.

  Digital Twin Layer:
  :  This layer includes three key subsystems: Data
     Repository subsystem, Service Mapping Models subsystem, and
     Network Digital Twin  Management subsystem.  These key subsystems
     can be placed in one single network administrative domain and
     provide the service to the application (e.g.,SDN controller) in
     other network administrative domain, or lied in every network
     administrative domain and coordinate between each other to provide
     services to the application in the upper layer.
   : One or multiple network digital twin instances can be built and
     maintained:

     *  Data Repository subsystem is responsible for collecting and
     storing various network data for building various models by
     collecting and updating the real-time operational data of
     various network elements through the twin southbound interface,
     and providing data services (e.g., fast retrieval, concurrent
     conflict handling, batch service) and unified interfaces to
     Service Mapping Models subsystem.

     *  Service Mapping Models complete data modeling, provide data
     model instances for various network applications, and maximizes
     the agility and programmability of network services.  The data
     models include two major types: basic and functional models.

         -  Basic models refer to the network element model(s) and
        network topology model(s) of the network digital twin based
        on the basic configuration, environment information,
        operational state, link topology and other information of
        the network element(s), to complete the real-time accurate
        characterization of the real network.

          -  Functional models refer to various data models used for
        network analysis, emulation, diagnosis, prediction,
        assurance, etc.  The functional models can be constructed
        and expanded by multiple dimensions: by network type, there
        can be models serving for a single or multiple network
        domains; by function type, it can be divided into state
        monitoring, traffic analysis, security exercise, fault
        diagnosis, quality assurance and other models; by network
        lifecycle management, it can be divided into planning,
        construction, maintenance, optimization and operation.
        Functional models can also be divided into general models
        and special-purpose models.  Specifically, multiple
        dimensions can be combined to create a data model for more
        specific application scenarios.
          New applications might need new functional models that do
          not exist yet.  If a new model is needed, ‘Service Mapping
          Models’ subsystem will be triggered to help creating new
          models based on data retrieved from ‘Data Repository’.

   *  Network Digital Twin Management fulfils the management function
     of network digital twin, records the life-cycle transactions of
     the twin entity, monitors the performance and resource
     consumption of the twin entity or even of individual models,
     visualizes and controls various elements of the network digital
     twin, including topology management, model management and
     security management.

> Notes: 'Data collection' and 'change control' are regarded as
  network-facing interfaces between virtual and real network.  From
  implementation perspective, they may form a sub-layer
  or sub-system to provide common data collection
  and change control functions, enabled by a specific infrastructure
  supporting bi-directional flows and facilitating data aggregation, action
  translation, pre-processing, and ontologies. It might not be possible or necessary
  to 'synchronize' all twin state or flows from twin entity to physical entity
  or network management system. Bi-directional interaction means that:
  data, state, or flows are reported or collected from the physical network or the network management
  system to a twin instance, and configure changes or 'necessary' data sent from a twin instance to
  physical.

  Application Layer:  Various applications (e.g., Operations,
     Administration, and Maintenance (OAM)) can effectively run over a
     network digital twin platform to implement either conventional or
     innovative network operations, with low cost and less service
     impact on real networks.  Network applications make requests that
     need to be addressed by the network digital twin.  Such requests
     are exchanged through a northbound interface, so they are applied
     by service emulation at the appropriate twin instance(s).

# Enabling Technologies to Build Network Digital Twin

This section briefly describes several key enabling technologies to
build digital twin work system, based on the challenges and the
reference architecture described in above sections.  Actually, each
enabling technology is worth of deep researching respectively and
separately.

##  Data Collection and Data Services

Data collection technology is the foundation of building data
repository for network digital twin.  Target driven mode should be
adopted for data collection from heterogeneous data sources.  The
type, frequency and method of data collection shall meet the
application of network digital twin.  Whenever building network
models for a specific network application, the required data can be
efficiently obtained from the data repository.

Diverse existing tools and methods (e.g., SNMP, NETCONF {{?RFC6241}},
IPFIX {{?RFC7011}}, and telemetry {{?RFC9232}}) can be used to collect
different type of network data.  YANG data models and associated
mechanisms defined in {{?RFC8639}}{{?RFC8641}} enable subscriber-specific
subscriptions to a publisher's event streams.  Such mechanisms can be
used by subscriber applications to request for a continuous and
customized stream of updates from a YANG datastore.  Moreover, some
innovative methods (e.g., sketch-based measurement) can be used to
acquire more complex network data, such as network performance data.
Furthermore, data transformation and aggregation capabilities can be
used to improve the applicability on network modelling.  Toward
building data repository for a digital twin system, data collection
tools and methods should be as lightweight as possible, so as to
reduce the volume of required network equipment resources, and
meaningful so it can be useful.  Several solutions related to data
collection are work-in-progress in IETF/IRTF, e.g., adaptive
subscription {{?I-D.ietf-netconf-adaptive-subscription}}, efficient data
collection {{?I-D.zcz-nmrg-digitaltwin-data-collection}}, and contextual
information {{?I-D.claise-opsawg-collected-data-manifest}}.

Data repository works to effectively store large-scale and
heterogeneous network data, as well provide data and services to
build various network models.  So, it is also necessary to study
technologies regarding data services including fast search, batch-
data handling, conflict avoidance, data access interfaces, etc.

## Network Modeling

The basic network element models and topology models help generate
virtual twin of the network according to the network element
configuration, operation data, network topology relationship, link
state and other network information.  Then the operation status can
be monitored and displayed, and the network configuration change and
optimization strategy can be pre-verified.

For small scale network, network simulating tools (e.g., {{NS-3}},
{{Mininet}}, etc.) and emulating tools (e.g., {{EVE-NG}}, {{GNS-3}}) can be
used to build basic network models.  By using the packet processing
capability of virtual network element, such tools can quickly verify
the functions of the control plane and data plane.  However, this
modeling method also has many limitations, including high resource
consumption, poor performance analysis ability, and poor scalability.
For large scale network, mathematical abstraction methods can be used
to build basic network models efficiently.  Knowledge graph, network
calculus, and formal verification can be candidate methods.  Some
relevant researches have emerged in recent years, such as [Hong2021],
{{G2-SIGCOMM}}, and {{DNA-2022}}.  Going forward, how to improve the
extensibility and accuracy of the models is still a big challenge.

As an example, the theory of bottleneck structures introduced in
{{G2-SIGCOMM}}, {{G2-SIGMETRICS}} can be used to construct a mathematical
model of the network (see also
{{?I-D.giraltyellamraju-alto-bsg-requirements}} for more info).  A
bottleneck structure is a computational graph that efficiently
captures the topology, the routing and flow properties of the
network.  The graph embeds the latent relationships that exist
between bottlenecks and the application flows in a distributed
system, providing an efficient mathematical framework to compute the
ripple effects of perturbations (e.g., a flow arriving or departing
from the system, or the dynamic change in capacity of a wireless
link, among others).  Because these perturbations can be seen as
mathematical derivatives of the communication system, bottleneck
structures can be used to compute optimized network configurations,
providing a natural engineering sandbox for building network models.
One of the key advantages of bottleneck structures is that they can
be used to compute (symbolically or numerically) key performance
indicators of the network (e.g., expected flow throughput, projected
flow completion time, etc.) without the need to use computationally
intensive simulators.  This capability can be especially useful when
building a digital twin or a large-scale network, potentially saving
orders or magnitude in computational resources in comparison to
simulation or emulation-based approaches.

The functional model aims to realize the dynamic evolution of network
performance evaluation and intelligent decision-making.  Data driven
AI/ML algorithm will play a great role in building complex network
functional models.  As a research hotspot in recent years, many
successfully cases have been demonstrated, such as {{RouteNet}},
{{MimicNet}}, etc.  In the future, in addition to improving the
generalization ability and interpretability of AI models, we also
need to focus on how to improve the real-time and interactivity of
model reasoning based on data and control in network digital twin
layer.

## Network Visualization

It is the internal requirement of the network digital twin system to
use network visibility technology to visually present the data and
model in the network twin with high fidelity and intuitively reflect
the interactive mapping between the real network entity and the
network twin.  Network Visibility technology can help users
understand the internal structure of the network, and also help mine
valuable information hidden in the network.

Network Visibility can use algorithms such as hierarchical layout,
heuristic layout or force oriented layout (or a combination of
several algorithms) for topology layout.  The related topology
data can be acquired using solutions provided in {{?RFC8345}},
{{?RFC8346}}, {{?RFC8944}}, etc.  Meanwhile, network digital twin system
can select different interaction methods or combinations of
interaction methods to realize the visual dynamic interaction mapping
of virtual and real networks.  The data query technology, such as
SPARQL, can be used to express queries across diverse data sources,
whether the data is stored natively as RDF or viewed as RDF via
middleware.

## Interfaces

Based on the reference architecture, there are three types of
interfaces on building a network digital twin system:

{: counter="bar" style="format (%c)"}
* Network-facing interfaces are twin interfaces between the real
   network and its twin entity.  They are responsible for
   information exchange between real network and network digital
   twin.  The candidate interfaces can be SNMP, NETCONF, etc.

* Application-facing interfaces are Application-facing interfaces
   between the network digital twin and applications.  They are
   responsible for information exchange between network digital twin
   and network applications.  The lightweight and extensible
   {{RESTFul}} interface can be the candidate northbound interface.

*  Internal interfaces are within network digital twin layer.  They
   are responsible for information exchange between the three
   subsystems: Data Repository, Service Mapping Models, and Digital
   Twin Network Management.  These interfaces should be of high-
   speed, high-efficiency and high-concurrency.  The candidate
   interfaces or protocols can be XMPP {{?RFC7622}} or
   HTTP/3.0 {{?RFC9114}}.

All these interfaces are recommended to be open and standardized interfaces so as to
avoid either hardware or software vendor lock, and achieve
interoperability.  Besides the interfaces list above, some new
interfaces or protocols can be created to better serve digital twin
network system.

## Twinning Management

Twinning management is the key to the efficient deployment and
potential value of network digital twin systems in production
networks.  Twinning management technology inputs all information and
data from each step of network business into the constructed model
through the construction of digital threads for optimization,
prediction, and guidance.  Then, the implementation results are
analyzed to see if they meet expectations, and any actions are fed
back to form a closed loop.  Twinning management involves various
network components (e.g., controller, orchestrator) and domains (security, for example)
from end to end, including, but not limited to, the
following main technologies:

*  Orchestration of twins: Manage and organize multiple twin
  model instances, including the creation, deletion, storage,
  version control, and deployment of model instances, and arrange
  required modeling resources as needed to maximize resource
  utilization efficiency.

*  Collaboration Management: Coordinate multiple participants, such
  as network administrators, data scientists, security teams, etc.,
  to ensure the accuracy and real-time performance of the twins.
  Involve collaborative tools, workflow design, data sharing, and
  permission control to promote cooperation and information sharing
  among all parties.

*  Conflict Detection and Resolution: Identify and address conflicts
  including user intents, access control policies, or multiple
  applications interacting within the digtial twin netowrk system.
  Conflict detection and resolution techniques may use various
  mechanisms, such as rule-based policies, role-based access
  control, or dynamic conflict resolution algorithms (e.g.
  {{Pradeep2022}} and {{Zheng2022}}).

*  Energy-Efficient Twinning: Focus on energy efficiency in digital
  twin network system.  It includes monitoring and optimizing the
  energy consumption of both network equipment and digital twin
  system operation, reducing the energy expenditure of network
  operation, and achieving the goal of green network.

# Interaction with Intent-Based Networking (IBN)

Intent-based, means that users can input their
abstract 'intent' to the network, instead of detailed policies or
configurations on the network devices.  {{?RFC9315}} clarifies the
concept of "Intent" and provides an overview of IBN functionalities.
The key characteristic of an IBN system is that user intent can be
assured automatically via continuously adjusting the policies and
validating the real-time situation.

IBN can be envisaged in a network digital twin context to show how
network digital twin improves the efficiency of deploying network
innovation.  To lower the impact on real networks, several rounds of
adjustment and validation can be emulated on the network digital twin
platform instead of directly on real network.  Therefore, the digital
twin network can be an important enabler platform to implement IBN
systems and fooster their deployment.

# Sample Application Scenarios

Network digital twin can be applied to solve different problems in
network management and operation.

## Human Training

The usual approach to network OAM with procedures applied by humans
is open to errors in all these procedures, with impact in network
availability and resilience.  Response procedures and actions for
most relevant operational requests and incidents are commonly defined
to reduce errors to a minimum.  The progressive automation of these
procedures, such as predictive control or closed-loop management,
reduce the faults and response time, but still there is the need of a
human-in-the-loop for multiples actions.  These processes are not
intuitive and require training to learn how to respond.

The use of network digital twin for this purpose in different network
management activities will improve the operators performance.  One
common example is cybersecurity incident handling, where "cyber-
range" exercises are executed periodically to train security
practitioners.  Network digital twin will offer realistic
environments, fitted to the real production networks.

## Machine Learning Training

Machine Learning requires data and their context to be available in
order to apply it.  A common approach in the network management
environment has been to simulate or import data in a specific
environment (the ML developer lab), where they are used to train the
selected model, while later, when the model is deployed in
production, re-train or adjust to the production environment context.
This demands a specific adaption period.

Network digital twin simplifies the complete ML lifecycle development
by providing a realistic environment, including network topologies,
to generate the data required in a well-aligned context.  Dataset
generated belongs to the network digital twin and not to the
production network, allowing information access by third parties,
without impacting data privacy.

## DevOps-Oriented Certification

The potential application of CI/CD models network management
operations increases the risk associated to deployment of non-
validated updates, what conflicts with the goal of the certification
requirements applied by network service providers.  A solution for
addressing these certification requirements is to verify the specific
impacts of updates on service assurance and Service Level Agreements
(SLAs) using a network digital twin environment replicating the
network particularities, as a previous step to production release.

Network digital twin control functional block supports such dynamic
mechanisms required by DevOps procedures.

## Network Fuzzing

Network management dependency on programmability increases systems
complexity.  The behavior of new protocol stacks, API parameters, and
interactions among complex software components are examples that
imply higher risk to errors or vulnerabilities in software and
configuration.

Network digital twin allows to apply fuzzing testing techniques on a
twin network environment, with interactions and conditions similar to
the production network, permitting to identify and solve
vulnerabilities, bugs and zero-days attacks before production
delivery.

## Network Inventory Management

With the development of enterprise digitization, the number of
enterprise Internet of Objects (IoT) devices, virtualized Cloud
software inventory component (e.g., virtual firewall), and network
hardware inventory (e.g., switches or routers) also increases.  The
endpoints connected to an enterprise network lack coherent modelling
and lifecycle management because different services are modelled,
collected, processed, and stored separately.  The same category of
network devices (including network endpoints) may be repeatedly
discovered, processed, and stored.  Therefore, the inventory is
difficult to manage when they are tracked in different places without
formal synchronization procedures.

Network digital twin management can be used as a means to ensure
consistent representation and reporting of inventory component types.
In doing so, the enforcement of security policies and assessment will
be further simplified.  Such an approach will ease implementing a
unified control strategy for all inventory components types connected
to an enterprise network.  It also make actors on assets more
accountable for breaching their compliance promises.  Special care
should be considered to protect the inventory data since it may be
gather privacy-sensitive information.

The network inventory management for twins or various inventory
components can be used, for example, to exercise the implication of
End of Life (EoL), dependency, and hardware dependency "what-if"
scenarios.

# Research Perspectives: A Summary

Research on network digital twin has just started.  This document
presents an overview of the network digital twin concepts and
reference architecture.  Looking forward, further elaboration on
network digital twin scenarios, requirements, architecture, and key
enabling technologies should be investigated by the industry, so as
to accelerate the implementation and deployment of digital twin
network.

# Security Considerations

This document describes concepts and definitions of digital twin
network.  As such, the following security considerations remain high
level, i.e., in the form of principles, guidelines or requirements.

Security considerations of the network digital twin include:

*  Secure the digital twin system itself.

*  Data privacy protection.

Securing the network digital twin system aims at making the digital
twin system operationally secure by implementing security mechanisms
and applying security best practices.  In the context of digital twin
network, such mechanisms and practices may consist in data
verification and model validation, mapping operations between real
network and digital counterpart network by authenticated and
authorized users only.

Synchronizing the data between the real network and the twin network
may increase the risk of sensitive data and information leakage.
Strict control and security mechanisms must be provided and enabled
to prevent data leaks.
