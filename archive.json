When testing some configuration changes or trying some innovative techniques, the digital twins can behave as a simulation platform without the need of real time telemetry data. And even in this scenario, it is better to have interactive mapping capability so that the validated changes can be tested in real network whenever required by the testers. In most other cases (e.g., network optimization, network fault recovery), real-time interaction between virtual and real network is mandatory. This way, network digital twin can help achieve the goal of autonomous network or self-driven network.\r\n\"",

That said, I think the presentation and discussion at Brisbane show we do in fact have a pretty close conceptual view. You proposed there to reorient the draft toward \"concept only\" and in fact Colin advised that IRTF should not get into architecture; I think that's a little over the top but in any case.",
