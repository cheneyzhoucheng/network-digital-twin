When testing some configuration changes or trying some innovative techniques, the digital twins can behave as a simulation platform without the need of real time telemetry data. And even in this scenario, it is better to have interactive mapping capability so that the validated changes can be tested in real network whenever required by the testers. In most other cases (e.g., network optimization, network fault recovery), real-time interaction between virtual and real network is mandatory. This way, network digital twin can help achieve the goal of autonomous network or self-driven network.\r\n\"",

That said, I think the presentation and discussion at Brisbane show we do in fact have a pretty close conceptual view. You proposed there to reorient the draft toward \"concept only\" and in fact Colin advised that IRTF should not get into architecture; I think that's a little over the top but in any case.",

As far as I am concerned, there is only one major problem with the latest draft \u2013 there is nothing else from my perspective that isn\u2019t adequately characterized as minor wordsmithing as part of a final editorial pass.\r\n\r\nThat major problem is the continued presence of Figure 2. This figure was the primary source of the issues expressed by those I represented in feedback. It has to go. \r\n\r\nPlease let me restate the issue. The first problem generated by Figure 2 is that it tells the world that an NDT is a controller. The second, connected, problem is it conflicts with the other NDT use cases. And a third serious problem is that the Figure was incomplete \u2013 a lot of functionality needed to make a controller, beyond the highlighted data and modeling functions, was missing from the picture and not even mentioned in the text (e.g. the closed loops \u2013 inner and outer, intent translation, etc.) \r\n\r\nThe point of the feedback is that it is better to consider an intent-driven controller as a use case of an NDT. Seeing it that way resolves all the problems. The data, modeling functions, and the functional management of both, are what are common to every NDT use case - and also the totality of what is now described in section 7. So call that the NDT. In any given use case, you have to combine these functions \u2013 the NDT - with a use case-dependent set of other functions. That is what section 8 addresses: and Figure 3 \u2013 which was intended to replace Figure 2 - illustrates this for the case of an intent-driven controller. \r\n\r\nThis gets you out of having to think about a bunch of different, use case-dependent types or flavors of NDTs.\r\n\r\nIf we can agree on this change I think we can wrap up quickly.\r\n",

This approach works well since it reflects a conceptual architecture rather than an implementation-specific design. This naturally leads into Figure 3, which takes the NDT concept and presents an applied example combined with a Controller, where 'Input' now represents an Intent and 'Output' functions as a control mechanism. Other examples of applied NDT might include planning and sensitivity analyses, where the input and output interfaces may differ again.",
